# E-commerce

This project was created as part of my application for an internship at **Elevate**. While the project is simple in its scope, I focused on writing scalable, maintainable, and well-structured code.

I leveraged **TypeScript**, **React.js**, **Vite**, and **Tailwind CSS** to build the application, adhering to clean code principles and following **SOLID** design principles. My goal was to ensure the project is easy to extend and maintain, even though the initial requirements are straightforward.

### Key Features:

- **Modular Codebase**: Organized using best practices to separate concerns and improve maintainability.
- **Scalability**: The project structure is built with growth in mind, making it easier to add new features or modules in the future.
- **Clean Code**: Emphasis on readability, simplicity, and consistency throughout the codebase.
- **Responsive UI**: Leveraged **Tailwind CSS** to create a responsive and modern user interface quickly and efficiently.

### Technologies Used:

- **React.js**: For building the user interface.
- **TypeScript**: For static typing and better tooling support.
- **Vite**: For fast development and building experience.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling the frontend with a utility-first approach.
