# Elevate Task (E-commerce) - React Application

This project was created as part of my application for an internship at **Elevate**. While the project is simple in its scope, I focused on writing scalable, maintainable, and well-structured code.

I leveraged **TypeScript**, **React.js**, **Vite**, and **Tailwind CSS** to build the application, adhering to clean code principles and following **SOLID** design principles. My goal was to ensure the project is easy to extend and maintain, even though the initial requirements are straightforward.

### Key Features:

- **Modular Codebase**: Organized using best practices to separate concerns and improve maintainability.
- **Scalability**: The project structure is built with growth in mind, making it easier to add new features or modules in the future.
- **Clean Code**: Emphasis on readability, simplicity, and consistency throughout the codebase.
- **Responsive UI**: Leveraged **Tailwind CSS** to create a responsive and modern user interface quickly and efficiently.

### Technologies Used:

- **React.js**: For building the user interface.
- **TypeScript**: For static typing and better tooling support.
- **Vite**: For fast development and building experience.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling the frontend with a utility-first approach.

The folder structure follows best practices:

- `services/` handles API requests and external data integration.
- `types/` defines types and interfaces to ensure strong typing across the application.
- `context/` is responsible for managing the global state using React's Context API.
- `components/` contains reusable UI components for modular development.

**How to Run the Application Locally:**

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AhmadAlabed/elevate-task.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd elevate-task
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the development server using Vite:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
5. Open the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
